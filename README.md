# Environment Project

## Project Overview
<p>
The Community Environmental Impact Tracker is an online tool to track and mitigate carbon emissions for individuals and communities. The project uses AI to give users their own carbon footprint calculator and ways to track, analyze, and minimize impact. User involvement in community challenges and sustainability objectives can also be encouraged so users can get involved in green projects and collaborate to create a positive change in the environment. 

It is for environmentally minded individuals, communities, and institutions who seek real-world, data-driven insights to make sustainable choices. By combining a heavy dose of community involvement and real-world AI advice, the Community Environmental Impact Tracker intends to give users more control over their decisions and contribute to a healthier world for all.
